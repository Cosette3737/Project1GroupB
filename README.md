2)	Implant
3)	Medical Specialty
•	Visualize with Matplotlib

Research Questions to Answer:

•	What specialty has the most accessories?
•	What type of device emits radiation?
•	What type of radiation is emitted?
•	What drugs uses biologics?

Tasks/Steps

1.Proposal- what questions are we trying to answer? Look at what kind of information do we want to answer?  

2.Gather Data-Gather multiple APIs that have detailed information on Medical Devices. upload files/links to repo

3.Check if Data answers questions- Look at data and see if it answers all questions, is missing information, or shows any other information needed.

4.Clean Data- Get data into notebook, merge if multiple sources used and use python to select data needed.  
  Look at data for missing rows/data/information, merge into one DF and set variables to be used for analysis.

5.Analysis-Examine data to see trends and patterns.  Create charts/graphs to visualize data trends. upload to repo

6.Combine Analysis Combine all data into one notebook upload to repo 

7.Final Analysis- Create final analysis if different from previous.  clean up graphs/charts with titles/ uniform wording/etc. upload to repo
8. Create Presentation  Create power point with data and analysis.  Upload to repo.
