4.Clean Data
Get data into notebook, merge if multiple sources used and use python to select data needed.  
 Look at data for missing rows/data/information, merge into one DF and set variables to be used for analysis.

5.Analysis
 Examine data to see trends and patterns.  
 Create charts/graphs to visualize data trends. upload to repo

  Combine all data into one notebook

7.Final Analysis 
  Create final analysis if different from previous.  clean up graphs/charts with titles/ uniform wording/etc. upload to repo

8. Create Presentation  
  Create power point with data and analysis.  Upload to repo.
