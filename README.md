## Project Title:  Medical Devices Data Analysis ##

### Team Members: Becky Joseph, Essi Monneus ###

#### Project Description/Outline: #####
Look at current trends of Medical Devices used in healthcare and how it has changed over the years. Create a visual analysis of data gathered to optimize the market of medical devices.  

## Final Analysis ##
Using the data from Open FDA, analysis can be completed of the medical device industry. Within this industry, there are many different categories to devide the devices into. These areas include medical specialty, class, recalls, adverse events, and device information per location.  Using the API from Open FDA, we learn that the Gastroenterology, and Urology, along with Clinical Chemistry, General and Plastic Surgery, and Microbiology have the highest amount of medical devices, in comparison to Genetics, Pathology and Radiology which have the least in medical specialty.  It may be easier to target the market in the top specialities.     
Have the devices changed in quality over the past few years?  Although the data available is minimal, the data indicates the states that have the highest number of events in 3 different time periods, 2015, 2019, and 2020 are almost the same.  California, Indiana, and Pennsylvania all appear in 2 of the 3 years examined.   Although this data may not be complete, due to states not indicated in the report. This undocumented stateâ€™s total is large enough to possibly change the top states within each year and make an impact on the top states.  While examining this data it may also be important to look into if these numbers could be due to higher number of events, or simply that those states have stricter guidelines and regulations in reporting adverse events.   The number of events in 2020 is almost the same as 2019, even though the year is not completed.  This could mean 2020 could have a higher number of events this year.  Between 2015, and 2020, California has had the same number of events, showing that the quality of devices has remained the same over the last 5 years.   
While looking at medical devices, it may be important to know where they were manufactured, to understand the regulations, codes, and adverse events reported for each device and its removal from market.  China, Canada, Denmark, and Taiwan are all top manufactures along with the United states in the medical device industry. 
Adverse effects are also reported and can be divided among category.  Malfunction is the highest amount of adverse effects, while death is the last.  Devices can also be grouped by class, and we can see that Class 2 has the highest number of devices, whereas Class 1 has the second, and Class 3 has the least. Within each class, we can determine which manufacturers had the most devices per class.  Looking at open recalls, we can also tell some important information about medical specialties and devices.  Even though radiology has the least number of devices in the market, it has the highest amount of open recalls, along with plastic and general surgery.  Surgical, Ceiling, and light mounts account for the higest devices with open recalls along with the interventional fluoroscopic Xray system, and tomography.  It is important to see that class 3 does not have any open recalls as those are life threatening and dealt with quickly.  












#Tasks/Steps

**1.Create Proposal:**
Treatment Device Proposal

* What are the different types of Devices?
  * Alternative Hypothesis: If cardiovascular devices are the most needed then they will have the highest sales.
  * Null Hypothesis:  If cardiovascular devices are the not most needed then they will not have the highest sales.

* What are the most common used in total and within each medical specialty.
   * Alternative Hypothesis: If Type 1 devices have the most premarket approvals in 2020  then Type 1 will be most common used.
   * Null Hypothesis:  If Type 1 devices do not have the most premarket approvals in 2020 then Type 1 will not be most common used.

* Has this trend changed over time? 
  * Alternative Hypothesis: If the Type 1 device trend is the same over time then it will have the same percentage in any year.
  * Null Hypothesis:  If the Type 1 device trend is not the same over time then it will not have the same percentage in any year.

* Which devices have the most recalls/flags?
  * Alternative Hypothesis: If medical devices have become more reliable in 2020, then the number of recalls will be less than in 1995? 
  * Null Hypothesis:  If medical devices have not become more reliable in 2020, then the number of recalls will be not be less than in 1995?


**2.Gather Data**
 * Gather multiple APIs that have detailed information on Medical Devices. 
 * load files/links to repo

**3.Check if Data answers questions**
 * Look at data and see if it answers all questions, is missing information, or shows any other information needed.

**4.Clean Data**
* Get data into notebook, merge if multiple sources used and use python to select data needed.  
* Look at data for missing rows/data/information, merge into one DF and set variables to be used for analysis.

**5.Analysis**
 * Examine data to see trends and patterns.  
 * Create charts/graphs to visualize data trends. upload to repo

**6.Combine Analysis** 
 * Combine all data into one notebook

**7.Final Analysis** 
 * Create final analysis if different from previous.  clean up graphs/charts with titles/ uniform wording/etc. upload to repo

**8. Create Presentation**  
  * Create power point with data and analysis.  Upload to repo.
