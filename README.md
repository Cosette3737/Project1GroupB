Alternative Hypothesis: If    Then
Null Hypothesis:  If Then



Does the device have an accessory/ what percentage of devices have accessories/which specialty has the most accessories?
Alternative Hypothesis: If    Then
Null Hypothesis:  If Then




2.Gather Data
Gather multiple APIs that have detailed information on Medical Devices. 
pload files/links to repo

3.Check if Data answers questions
Look at data and see if it answers all questions, is missing information, or shows any other information needed.

4.Clean Data
Get data into notebook, merge if multiple sources used and use python to select data needed.  
 Look at data for missing rows/data/information, merge into one DF and set variables to be used for analysis.

5.Analysis
 Examine data to see trends and patterns.  
 Create charts/graphs to visualize data trends. upload to repo

6.Combine Analysis 
  Combine all data into one notebook

7.Final Analysis 
  Create final analysis if different from previous.  clean up graphs/charts with titles/ uniform wording/etc. upload to repo

8. Create Presentation  
  Create power point with data and analysis.  Upload to repo.
